## Publication abstract

Spatial taphonomy complements the traditional taphonomic approach. By applying advanced spatial statistical methods, it aims to investigate the multiscale and multilevel spatial properties of biostratinomic and diagenetic processes. In this study, we elaborate on a specific aspect - spatial anisotropy - of taphonomic processes. Circular statistics are used for the fabric analysis of elongated elements; geostatistics (directional variograms), wavelet and point pattern analyses are applied for detecting anisotropy at the assemblage level. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility of sedimentary magnetic minerals is as well investigated. This study aims to unravel the taphonomic history of the Early Pleistocene vertebrate assemblage Tsiotra Vryssi (Mygdonia Basin, Macedonia, Greece), with respect to the specific depositional environment, the number of depositional events (single or multiple) and the degree of transportation of the fossil record (autochthonous vs. allochthonous assemblage). The results of our multiscale and multilevel analysis of anisotropy, integrated with preliminary remarks about the differential preservation of skeletal elements, sedimentological and micromorphological observations, suggest multiple dispersion events and recurrent spatial re-arrangement of a lag, (peri)autochthonous assemblage, consistent with the cyclical lateral switching of a braided fluvial system. Spatial taphonomy enhances our understanding of taphonomic modification processes, in turn with consequences for palaeoecological reconstructions and biochronological estimates. Furthermore, this study offers an important contribution to the building of a spatial taphonomic referential framework for the interpretation of other fossil vertebrate assemblages, including archaeo palaeontological ones.
